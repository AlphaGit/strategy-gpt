## 1. Repo Setup

- [x] 1.1 Tag current `main` as `pre-rewrite` so the reference implementation remains accessible
- [x] 1.2 Remove the existing reference implementation from `main` (keep `cache/` ignore rules and project metadata)
- [x] 1.3 Create the polyglot layout: `crates/` (Rust workspace root with `Cargo.toml`), `python/` (orchestrator package), `kb/` (ingestion scripts), `cache/` (gitignored), `ledger/` (gitignored)
- [x] 1.4 Add Rust toolchain pin (`rust-toolchain.toml`) and `sccache` configuration in `crates/`
- [x] 1.5 Initialize Python project under `python/` with `pyproject.toml`, dependency groups for `langgraph`, `pyo3` consumer bindings, `duckdb`/`sqlite3`, anthropic/openai SDKs
- [x] 1.6 Wire `pyo3-build-config`/`maturin` so the Python package can import the Rust crates as native extensions
- [x] 1.7 Update `CLAUDE.md` with the new layout and remove outdated "reference implementation" notes once phase 2 lands

## 2. Strategy Runtime — `crates/engine-rt`

- [x] 2.1 Define the sealed `Strategy` trait with `metadata`, `on_init`, `on_bar`, `on_fill`, `on_end` lifecycle methods

- [ ] 2.3 Implement the backtest fill simulator and position-accounting primitives that `Context` delegates to (next-bar-open and current-bar-close fill models, fee/slippage hooks, per-symbol position aggregation). No live order book, no cancellation pathway.
